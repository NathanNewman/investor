This project is called Investor. It's a competitive investor website designed using Python Flask and JavaScript JQuery. It gets stockmarket data from the Alpha Advantage API. It is styled using CSS, Bootstrap, and Font Awesome. The purpose is to showcase some of what I have learned in the Springboard Bootcamp up to this point.

The website features include: User signup, login, and logout; stock market portfolio creation and a leader
board. You can also edit and delete your user profile and portfolios. There is a search bar to search for other
users. Their profiles and portfolios can also be viewed.
